# Project Plan
## Title
Analyzing Patterns and Outcomes of Crimes and Arrests in Urban Areas of Los Angeles in USA.


## Description
This research intends to map out and compare the types of crimes and the corresponding arrests made, examining how these vary from one urban area to another. By integrating data from both crime reports and arrest records, the project will identify prevalent crime-arrest patterns, and explore demographic trends among both victims and offenders in Los Angeles from 2020 to present.


## Main Questions
-Does the frequency and type of arrests in specific neighborhoods correlate with reductions in crime rates over time in those same areas? <br />
-Is there a pattern in victim demographics (age, sex, descent) for specific types of crimes?


## Datasources
